## 1.14.0

- Added `/setup-config` command - an interactive wizard for configuring LLM providers and MCP servers with built-in templates for popular services. Includes real-time validation, manual editing support (Ctrl+E), and automatic configuration reload.
- Revamped testing setup to now:
  - Check formatting with Prettier
  - Check types with tsc
  - Check for linting errors with Eslint
  - Run AVA tests
  - Test for unnused code and dependencies with Knip
- The full test suite passes for version 1.14.0 with no errors or warnings. Nanocoder should feel and work more robustly than ever!

## 1.13.7

- Updated `LICENSE.md` to be `MIT License with Attribution`. This was done to keep the spirit of MIT but also ensure the technology built by contributors is properly credited.
- We added a new system prompt with better instructions, ordering, tool documentation and included system information.

  - Old system prompts are dated using the following format: `yyyy-mm-dd-main-prompt.md` where the date is when the prompt was retired.

- Fix: import aliases within the code now use `@/` syntax _without_ file extensions. This is an under-the-hood refactor to improve code readability and use more modern standards.
- Fix: All but the last message in the chat was made static through Ink. This still causes _some_ terminal flicker if the last message was a long one. All messages are immediately made static now to further improve performance.

## 1.13.6

- Added `CHANGELOG.md` and rolled out changelogs to releases.
- Updated the `/clear` command output UI to read "Chat Cleared." over "‚úîÔ∏è Chat Cleared..."
- Refactored `langgraph-client.ts` to removed old methods that are no longer needed. Rolled out this change to `useChatHandler.tsx`. This results in smaller, more tidy files.
- Fix: LangGraph errors leaked through to UI display. This is now tidied to be from Nanocoder.
- Fix: Pressing Escape to cancel model responses was not instant and sometimes didn't work.
