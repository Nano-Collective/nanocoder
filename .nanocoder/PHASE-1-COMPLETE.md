# Phase 1: AI SDK Type Foundation - COMPLETE ✅

**Date:** October 31, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Summary

Phase 1 of the AI SDK migration is now complete. This phase established the type foundation for future phases by importing and exporting AI SDK's native types while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing OpenAI-compatible message format.

## What Was Completed

### 1. AI SDK Type Imports and Exports (`source/types/core.ts`)

- ✅ Imported AI SDK's `CoreMessage`, `CoreSystemMessage`, `CoreUserMessage`, `CoreAssistantMessage`, `CoreToolMessage` types
- ✅ Created `AISDKTool` type for AI SDK tool definitions
- ✅ Exported `tool()` and `jsonSchema()` helpers for tool definitions
- ✅ Added comprehensive documentation explaining migration status

### 2. Documentation Updates

- ✅ Updated header comment in `core.ts` with:
  - Phase 1 and Phase 2 completion status
  - Phase 3 TODO items
  - Explanation of why we can't just alias types (structural differences between OpenAI format and AI SDK format)
- ✅ Added JSDoc comment to `ToolDefinition` interface explaining the Phase 2 architecture
- ✅ Added note in `read-file.tsx` about intentionally exported `*CoreTool` exports for Phase 3

### 3. Build and Test Verification

- ✅ Project builds successfully with `pnpm build`
- ✅ All type checks pass with `pnpm test:types`
- ✅ All 276 unit tests pass
- ✅ Code formatting verified with Prettier
- ✅ Linting passes (8 warnings related to `any` types in ai-sdk-client.ts - intentional)

## Key Decisions

### Why Not Type Aliases?

The original migration proposal suggested creating type aliases like:

```typescript
export type Message = CoreMessage;
```

However, this approach doesn't work because:

1. **Structural Differences**: Our `Message` type uses OpenAI's format with `tool_calls`, `tool_call_id`, and `name` fields
2. **AI SDK Format**: `CoreMessage` has a different structure with content arrays and different tool formats
3. **Need Migration, Not Aliasing**: We need actual message format conversion, which will be handled in Phase 3

### AISDKTool Type

We defined `AISDKTool` as `any` because:

- The `tool()` function is generic and returns `Tool<INPUT, OUTPUT>` where types vary per tool
- We don't auto-execute tools anyway (human-in-the-loop pattern)
- This provides flexibility while maintaining type safety where it matters (the handler functions)

### Exported CoreTool Instances

All 10 tools export their `*CoreTool` instances (e.g., `readFileCoreTool`):

- These are marked as unused by knip - this is intentional
- They're reserved for Phase 3 when we migrate message handling
- Comment added to document this is not dead code

## Migration Status

| Phase   | Status      | Description                                          |
| ------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Phase 1 | ✅ COMPLETE | Type foundation - AI SDK types imported and exported |
| Phase 2 | ✅ COMPLETE | Tool definitions migrated to AI SDK format           |
| Phase 3 | ❌ TODO     | Message format migration to `CoreMessage`            |
| Phase 4 | ❌ TODO     | Simplify AI SDK client, remove conversion code       |
| Phase 5 | ❌ TODO     | Evaluate MCP client migration (optional)             |
| Phase 6 | ❌ TODO     | Comprehensive testing and documentation              |

## What Phase 1 Enables

With Phase 1 complete, we now have:

1. **Type Foundation**: All AI SDK types are available for use in future phases
2. **Tool Helpers**: `tool()` and `jsonSchema()` are available throughout the codebase
3. **Clear Documentation**: Comments explain the current state and what needs to happen next
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work with OpenAI-compatible format

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

The critical next phase is **Phase 3: Message Format Migration**:

1. Migrate from custom `Message` type to AI SDK's `CoreMessage` throughout the codebase
2. Remove `convertMessagesToAISDK()` function in `ai-sdk-client.ts`
3. Use proper `CoreToolMessage` format instead of converting tool results to user messages
4. Update all hooks (`useAppState`, `useChatHandler`, `useToolHandler`) to use `CoreMessage`
5. Update components to handle `CoreMessage` types
6. Use `response.messages` directly from AI SDK instead of manual conversion

## Files Changed

- `source/types/core.ts` - Updated with AI SDK types and documentation
- `source/tools/read-file.tsx` - Added comment about exported CoreTool
- `knip.json` - Verified configuration (no changes needed)

## Testing Results

```bash
✅ Format check passed
✅ Type check passed
✅ Lint check passed (8 warnings - intentional)
✅ 276 AVA tests passed
⚠️  Knip reports 10 unused exports (*CoreTool) - intentional for Phase 3
```

## Conclusion

Phase 1 is successfully complete. The type foundation is now in place for the remaining migration phases. The codebase continues to function identically to before, with no behavioral changes - this was purely a type refactoring phase as intended.

**Next Action:** Review Phase 3 migration proposal and begin message format migration.
